DO NOT ADD THE IDEA FILE FOR SUBMISSION

TODO:
when No option is selected while having a list prompt if the user wants to exit
tasks get ordered according to priority level
parsing the inputs more (date formula, )
input shall not be left empty if so, user gets prompted again
the executable saves/logs the data in a file for reference
we should free after getting done with everything
update the struct with all the info related to tasks (description, priority, etc)
